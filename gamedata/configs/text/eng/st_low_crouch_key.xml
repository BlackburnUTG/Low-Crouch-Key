		<text>If this is off: walk key toggles the walk state. That means that if you are not walking - you start walking by pressing walk key. And if you are already walking - by pressing walk key - walk is canceled and you start moving with normal speed.\n\nIf this is on: walk key dont toggles walk state. Pressing walk key will always make you walk. To start move with normal speed you need to tap sprint key. Another feature: the game will remember your previous 'speed' when you stand up (If u walk, then press crouch key twice to crouch and to stand up: you will be in walk state again)
